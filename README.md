🗳️ 2024 India General Elections Data Analysis Project
📌 Introduction
This project is centered around analyzing data from the 2024 India General Elections using SQL. The goal is to extract and analyze key insights,
such as the total number of seats won by political alliances, state-wise voting trends, and candidate performance. Throughout this project,
I used advanced SQL queries and data modeling techniques to generate meaningful insights from the raw election data.

📈 Problem Statement
The objective of the project is to analyze election results data and gain insights into how different political alliances performed 
across states, how votes were distributed (EVM vs. Postal votes), and which candidates secured the highest number of votes. The project answers questions such as the distribution
of seats across alliances, state-wise analysis, and the performance of individual parties.

⚙️ Functionalities 
This project offers a deep dive into the following key areas of data analysis and SQL functionality:

Creating and managing databases
Writing complex SQL queries for data extraction and analysis
Performing aggregations and calculations to derive insights from data
Filtering and summarizing data based on specific criteria
Understanding how to structure data for easier querying and visualization
Working with different types of voting data (EVM vs. Postal votes)
📊 Data Overview
The dataset contains detailed information on election results across India, including:

Total Seats
State-wise Seats
Votes (EVM vs Postal)
Political Alliances
Candidate Vote Counts This data provides a comprehensive view of the election results and allows for granular analysis at various levels.
📂 Data Preparation
To begin, I performed a Raw Data Walkthrough to familiarize myself with the structure and contents of the dataset. From there, I moved on to the Schema/ERD Diagram, 
which outlines the relationships between tables and data points within the dataset.

🛠 Database Creation and Data Import
I set up the SQL Database to store the raw election data. The next step involved importing the data into SQL, ensuring that it was structured appropriately for querying and analysis.

📝 SQL Queries for Election Data Analysis
Here are the SQL queries I developed for analyzing the election data:

Total Seats Query: This query calculates the total number of seats contested in the election.

State-wise Total Seats Query: I broke down the total number of seats contested in each state, providing a clearer picture of regional representation.

Seats Won by NDA Alliance & I.N.D.I.A Alliance: I wrote separate queries to calculate the number of seats won by the NDA Alliance and the I.N.D.I.A Alliance across India.
These queries allowed me to compare the performance of the two major political alliances.

Seats Won by Individual Parties within Alliances: I further drilled down to calculate the number of seats won by each party within the NDA and I.N.D.I.A alliances.

Party-wise and Alliance-wise State Analysis: This query shows how many seats each political alliance won within specific states, providing valuable insights into regional performance.

EVM Votes vs Postal Votes: I created a query to compare EVM votes (Electronic Voting Machine) with Postal votes, giving an understanding of how voting methods affected the results.

Maximum Seats Won in a State: I extracted information about the states where alliances won the most seats, helping to highlight strongholds for each alliance.

Highest Vote to Candidates: This query finds the candidates who received the highest number of votes, showcasing popular leaders across different states.

Winner and Lost Candidates: I also analyzed the winning and losing candidates, helping identify who succeeded and who faced defeat in the elections.

State-wise Votes: I summarized the total number of votes received by candidates within each state, providing a granular breakdown of voting behavior across regions.

⚙️ Adding New Fields and Custom Queries
In addition to the base analysis, I added custom fields to the dataset, such as calculating the Vote Margin for each candidate.
I also wrote custom queries to compare party alliances' performance across different states.

🌍 Advanced State-wise and Alliance Analysis
To further enhance the analysis, I performed advanced queries such as:

Specific State Victory Analysis: Which parties or alliances emerged victorious in a specific state?
Seats Won by Alliances in a State: A breakdown of seats won by different alliances within a state, helping to understand local dynamics.
🏅 Outcome of the Analysis
By the end of this project, I was able to:

Understand how alliances performed across states and regions
Visualize voting trends (EVM vs. Postal) and identify popular candidates
Provide in-depth analysis of election results based on SQL queries
🔧 Advanced SQL Techniques Used
This project required the use of advanced SQL techniques such as:

Join Operations: For combining data across multiple tables
Group By: For aggregating data by state, party, or candidate
Case Statements: For conditional logic in queries
Subqueries: For nested analysis, allowing more complex insights

🎯 Key Learnings and Functionalities
Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience with real-world election data and advanced SQL functionalities, such as:

Schema/ERD Design: Understanding relationships between data entities
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Managing data import and transformation
Advanced SQL Functions: Implementing complex queries to derive actionable insights
🏁 Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the 2024 India General Elections using SQL, offering key insights into voting trends, party 
, and regional dynamics. By working on this project, I improved my SQL skills, learned how to analyze real-world data, and gained a better understanding of the electoral landscape in India.
